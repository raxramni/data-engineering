Setting up the application:

  The application is written in Sinatra. 
   
  To start the application:

   1) bundle

   2) ruby app.rb


  To use the application:

   http://localhost:4567       #if the default port on which sinatra is running is 4567

  to login, use any of the OPENID identifiers - for example, from google, yahoo, etc
  for example, for google, enter:  https://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id  in the identifier field and complete the authentication

  once loggedin, upload a tab-delimited file to be loaded into the sqlite database(configured by default)
